bGames is a technology designed to create a balance between daily activities and video games. Your daily tasks help you improve in games! With bGames, you can earn points based on your daily activities. Using sensors, your data is collected and transformed into points, which can be used to enhance your character in the game.

The application includes three sensors, each collecting specific data and converting it into bGames points:
- **Steam Sensor:** Captures the hours played during the day. The more you play, the fewer points you earn.
- **Reddit Sensor:** Captures the karma gained during the day.
- **StackOverflow Sensor:** Tracks the reputation earned on your account throughout the day.

# How to run the bGames sensor

- You need to download the cloud services from [bGames](https://github.com/BlendedGames-bGames/bGames-dev-services.git).
- Download the [aplication](https://github.com/MoisesGodoy17/sensor-steam-react/releases/tag/sensor-bgames)
- Navigate to the `sensor-steam-react-win32-x64` folder and click on the `sensor-steam-react.exe` executable.

(**The sensor captures data at 22:00, so the application must be running for it to function correctly.**)

# Running the application
To start the project, enter the following command in the console:

```

---

# Exporting the application
To export the application, you need to edit the following files:
- `electron.js` (path: `\sensor-steam-react\public\electron.js`)
- `vite.config.js`
- `package.json`

Each file contains instructions for the necessary modifications. Once these changes are made, install the required dependencies:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
```

After installing the library, build the front-end using the following command:

```shell
npm run build:frontend 
```

Finally, build the entire project:

```shell
npm run make
```

This will create a folder named `Out`, which will contain the exported application in `.exe` format at:

```
\sensor-steam-react\out\sensor-steam-react-win32-x64\sensor-steam-react.exe
```
